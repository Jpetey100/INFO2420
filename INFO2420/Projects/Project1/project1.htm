<h2>Website 1 Critique Utah National Parks</h2>
<h4><a href/"http://www.utah.com/nationalparks/">www.utah.com</a></h4>

<ol>
	<li>My first impression was good, although the link brought me to a page that said "Oops! Couldn't find that."</li>
	
	<li>They have links on the top bar that had categories and you would click on a category and it would bring up more links</li>
	
	<li>Yes, to me the structure makes sense, it looks like other websites I have seen.</li>
	
	<li>I think that it enhances the experience. They chose a picture of it looks like arches national park and it gets me excited to see more</li>
	
	<li>The loading was almost instant to bring up the page</li>
	
	<li>Everything in the website enhanced the experience for me. The text was clear but the photos made it look colorful and fun.</li>
	
	<li>Yes it does have one at the top right, and yes it looks well done.</li>
	
	<li>I don't think it was repeated. Given the fact that every page had different photos of different places it did not repeat.</li>
	
	<li>It responds great to smaller sizes.</li>
	
	<li>I really liked all the colors and the pictures of national parks and how easy it was to find stuff in the top categories bar.</li>
